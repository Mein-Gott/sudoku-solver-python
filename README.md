# sudoku-solver-python
  
A python program able to solve standard (9x9) sudoku puzzles.

## Installation
Clone the repo to your computer.

## Usage
1. Open the `play_with_it.py` file
2. Type your sudoku into the `starting_grid`
    - Each sublist represents a row
    - Zeros represent empty cells
3. Then just run the `play_with_it.py` file. The final grid is printed after a while.

## Glossary
If sudoku terms aren't familiar to you, I recommend reading the [Wikipedia Sudoku Glossary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Sudoku)
before diving into the code.  

I came up with this one, I don't know if it's a real term but here it is:
- `groupset` = all the groups of a given group type, for example all rows or all regions
